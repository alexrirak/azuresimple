## Software
 * We have been using Intellij for all of our development so this will assume you have intellij. <small>(If you don't you can grab it from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) )</small>
   * Intellij also has an Azure plugin which you can install, but I haven't tried it out too extensively yet
 * Next you will want to install the Azure CLI and Functions CLI
   * [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli)
   * [Functions CLI](https://aka.ms/azfunc-install)
